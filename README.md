# Movie App ðŸŽ¬

## Description

This Single Page Application (SPA) is a movie catalog designed to showcase, filter, and sort the extensive film collection available through The Movie Database (TMDB) API V3.

## Key Features

*   **Movie Listing:** Users can view the catalog of movies in a table format with rows and columns.
*   **Pagination**: Users can navigate through the movie catalog divided into pages.
*   **Filtering & Sorting:** Enables users to filter by genre and sort by popularity and title (ascending/descending).
*   **Movie Details:** Provides in-depth information about each movie, including title, overview, poster, rating, and genre.

## Tech Stack

*   **React:** The core of the project, chosen for its component-based structure that promotes clean and maintainable code.
*   **TypeScript:** Added strong typing to JavaScript, catching errors early and making the codebase more reliable.
*   **TMDB API:** This provided the rich movie data that drives the app. Integration was smooth and let me focus on the front-end.
*   **Testing (Jest):**  Wrote unit and integration tests with Jest to ensure the app works as expected and is less prone to bugs.
*   **Deployment (Vercel):**  Deployed on Vercel for easy access.

## Development Process

### 1.  Prototyping:

- Started with a low-fidelity prototype (provided by the Product Owner) to visualize the basic layout and user flow.
- Translated the low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity Figma design, refining the visual aspects and interactions.
